Interactive Rating System v0.1

Completed the first part of the requirement where the rating page is displayed.
Points to change on next iteration : 
1. Need to redirect to the rating submitted page after clicking on submit button.
2. Need to store and pass the rating message if any to the next page.
Points to be noted : 
1. If "li" is used for the rating then :active won't work. Either to change "li" to "a" or descope the active state as part of functinality limitations.


Interactive Rating System v0.2

Solved the issue of focusing the "li" items with the "tabIndex=0" on list item.It is used with on input tags where you want to add focus attribute to.

Next Steps : 
1. Need to make a thank you page for the feedback.
2. Need to pass the data inputed to the HTML back to the thank you page with the help of javascript.

Interactive Rating System v1.0

There was bug in the code for "tabIndex = 0".tabIndex only letting us to focus the "li" element but if we click out of the menu then the focus on the "li" is going away. Changed the functionality of the "li" with "tabIndex" to a "button" under the "li" tag.

<li class="rating-1"><button>1</button></li>

Basic functionality of the website is completed. Passed the value by editing the document and made the thank-you page under the same index.js with visiblity as "hidden".

********Release the Website as the basic functionality is covered.********
