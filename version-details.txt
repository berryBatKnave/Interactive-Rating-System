Completed the first part of the requirement where the rating page is displayed.
Points to change on next iteration : 
1. Need to redirect to the rating submitted page after clicking on submit button.
2. Need to store and pass the rating message if any to the next page.
Points to be noted : 
1. If "li" is used for the rating then :active won't work. Either to change "li" to "a" or descope the active state as part of functinality limitations.
